# SharePriceCalculator

This program computes and print out the sums of all gains and losses of the share prices.

Example:
This is the sample input of share prices : 78.41 85.18 91.09 90.57 91.02 103.61 105.88 103.77 110.13 108.89 105.09
In the above example, the price was down from the previous day on the fourth, eighth and tenth days, losing 7.67 in total over all three days, and up on every other day, gaining 34.35 in total.

The program will compute and return profitValue : 34.35 and lossValue : -7.67

##Assumptions

1. If there is one or 0 value then profit and loss value will be 0, this program will compure profit and loss value if number of elements is more than 1.
